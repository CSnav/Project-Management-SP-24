#### Project Purpose
Traditional card combat games usually excel at strategic gameplay and offers almost endless possibilities ands combinations when it comes to combat, but often lacks a bit in terms of exploration and storytelling. And the roguelike dungeon crawlers often do a good job in exploration mechanics, but often have comparably simpler combat mechanics. The project is aimed to combine the strategy-heavy card combat mechanics into traditional dungeon crawlers as well as introducing mechanics like inventory based card deck building and base building into the game. The project is aimed to bring a unique and fresh design into the video game market.

#### Project Scope
The project is aimed to be ultimately published on PC platform electronically via Steam. _The game should be aimed at a launch date in Q4 2025 - Q2 2026_ 
- The main part of the game should be aimed to have a length of around 14-16 hours.
- The game should have a complete main story line
- The final product should have completed roguelike elements including character skill progression and base building
- The final product should have completed exploration elements that has at least 3 different enemy faction/biomes and procedurally generated missions & maps with difficulty progression.
- The final product should have completed combat elements that include offer a large selection of equipment/cards, which can be crafted or obtained through exploration, trading & combat. Or to be further customized.

#### Target Audience
- The game's primary audience should be male video game players aged 16-30 years old that primarily plays PC games and has an interest in roguelike games and card games/dungeon crawler games. 
- The game's secondary audience should be video game players who has had experience with darkest dungeon / slay the spire and is looking for games that incorporate elements from those two games. 

### III. Platform & Tools
- **Development Platform**: Unreal engine<br />
The reason for this choice is that the current technical build which already has the basic system structure implemented exists in Unreal engine due to current coder's expertise.
- **Version control**: Github<br />
This provide version control within the team, and also enables the open-sourceness of this project after the game launch. The source-code of the project will be published in an aim to further help and enable game's modding community. Reference [Barotrauma](https://barotraumagame.com/uncategorized/662/) who used a similar strategy.
- **Project management Platform**: Jira<br />
The project will be managed with Agile methodology and team will track their issues and work using Jira. Sprint duration will be every 2 weeks.

- **Communication & Meeting Platform**: Discord & Zoom<br />
Everyday communication and updates within the team will be initiated via team’s project discord channel. A new channel will be build & managed for managing game community after the game’s beta release on steam, community events like modding competitions will be hosted periodically. <br />
Team meetings and official communications will happen via scheduled Zoom sessions.

### V. Open source
Although the initial development of the game will be conducted as a private project during the game's initial development. The goal is to release the game's source code on github after the game's full release, while the team will have its own core development branch to continue game's update. Modder will have access to files that can fork them to help with the development of mods/improving the game. This helps to enhence feedback and creativity within the game's modding community. Clear guidelines for the community will be esatblished for the community and its users, and development progress and milestones will be kept transparent to the community after the beta release. 

### VI. Project Roadmap

#### Phase 1: development to reach GDC Independent game festival
GDC independent game festival would be a good opputunity for the game to gain publicity and meet potiential publishers/investors. Although the festival itself is on March, the deadline for handing in materials is October, which will act as our first milestone.
##### 1.1: Design & recruitment
- **Phase duration**: May 20th 2024 -  June 20th 2024
- **Phase objectives**:<br />
1. conduct market research and refine the current design <br />
2. recuirtment of core team (at least 2 coders, 1 concept artist, 2 designers, 1 production, and 2 aritst) <br />
3. setting up project structure, roadmap, and initial documentation <br />

##### 1.2: Pre-production
- **Phase duration**: June 20th 2024 -  August 20th 2024
- **Phase objectives**:<br />
1. refine the current design <br />
2. recuirtment of core team (at least 2 coders, 1 concept artist, 2 designers, 1 production, and 2 aritst) <br />
3. setting up project structure, roadmap, and initial documentation <br />

##### 1.3: Enter production
- **Phase duration**: August 20th 2024 - Oct 2024
- **Phase objectives**:<br />
1. Art asset creation and implementation
2. Expansion of game content
3. Playtesting and refinement

#### Phase 2: Releasing steam beta & hitting next fest
Steam beta will be a great oppunity to test out market feedback + collect alot of playtest feedback. Next Fest would be a opputunity for marketing. 
##### 2.1: Production & beta publishing
- **Phase duration**: November 1st, 2024 - Feb 2025
- **Phase objectives**:<br />
1. Continue expanding features & art
2. Testing & Releasing beta build
3. Advertisement & publication for steam beta
4. Data collection and feedback analysis

#### Phase 3: Continue development & Tencent GWB 
Tencent GWB is a good opputunity to meet with publisher & developer for the Asia market, also since the competition is fairly new, lower amount of competition can probably be expected. 
##### 3.1: Continue production
- **Phase duration**: November, 2024 - Feb 2025
- **Phase objectives**:<br />
1. Game improvment based on beta reception
2. Further feature & art expansion
3. Marketing & foster community growth
4. Managing community & increase social capital through community discord
   
#### Phase 4: 1.0 Release
This is official release of the game to steam platform, alot of publishing & marketing prepreations needed as well as expected influx of need for hotfixes and balancing from the 1.0 feedback. For project scope, check section II. 
##### 4.1: Production & Game publication
- **Phase duration**: Feb 2025 - Oct 2025
- **Phase objectives**:<br />
1. Game improvment based on GWB reception
2. Marketing & Publishing preparation for 1.0 release
3. Publication of 1.0 release on steam
4. Data collection and analyzation from player feedback

#### Phase 5: Bug fixes, source-code release 
This is the phase where the project goes open-source. Before that, balancing and hotfixes need to happen to bring the project into a stable phase. For open-source principles, check section V. After this phase, post-launch development will happen. But scope won't be specified in this document.
##### 5.1: Bug fixes, balancing & go open source
- **Phase duration**: Oct 2025 - Dec 2025
- **Phase objectives**:<br />
1. Hotfixes, balancing & bug fix updates based on player feedback.
2. Bring game to a stable build
4. Draft neccesary documents & guidelines for project to go open source
5. Release source code on github
6. Provide community support and foster after open-source change
7. Post launch updates

### VII. Sprint Plan
The project will be managed through a mix of Agil and Waterflow methodologies. On the higher level, the project's development iwll be divided into individual 2-week sprints. Where team will go through the sprint planning, sprint review, sprint retro cycle every single sprint. All teams (programming, art, desigm, sound, QA, writing, production) will work largely in parallel and make every single sprint a repeatable cycle of design, testing and iteration. However in the meantime, when it comes to art asset creation, the artists' tasks will be tracked largely via traditional waterfall methods where their work will be based on an asset list (which traslate to the project backlog). Same goes to the open-source part of the project, where issues reported & suggested through github will be listed and assigned via traditional waterfall method. <br />

For the sprint plan specifically, the start of every sprint will be when the sprint retro & planning took place. And throughout the sprint, stand-up meetings will take place every 3 days. This is a short virtual team meeting that took around 2-3 minutes from each individual members. And during the stand-up meeting members will showcase their current progress, identify potiential roadblocks, and request assistance from other team members needed. This will serve as an effective way to increase team communication and asist in identifying the roadblocks in the project effecienctly.

### VIII. Chanlleges
#### 1. Technical Debt 
##### Challenge description 
A lot of technical debt can be projected for this project, especially during the later and final stages of production. Since the team is all students with personal interest, the coding expertise level will vary between people across the programing team. Additionally, changes in the team size will likely happen constantly through out the project because of the student status for the team members, people will likely join and leave constant due to circumstances such as graduation, academical and personal work. All of these causes complications in work transition which increases the chance of technical debt to appear.  

##### Challenge solution
- Frequent programmer meetings, mandatory sprint code review and merge review meetings
- Early notice for instances when a programmer is leaving the team, find replacement early and onboard when the programmer that is leaving is still in the team to ensure smoother transition of work.

#### 2. Unstable schedule
##### Challenge description 
As mentioned in chanllege 1, the team members will likely come and go throughout the project duration. Added to this, team member's aviliablity in terms of number of hours they can contribute each week varies very heavily. Situations like mid-term, break, or exams can heavily impact one's aviliablity, so the progress of the sprint will likely shift around alot throughout development. The team's overall inexeprience also makes schedule estiamtion very difficult, causing possibility in needed adjustments to the high-level milestones and schedule. 

##### Challenge solution
- Establish frequent and open communication inside the team when it comes to noticing about situation that can impact one's aviliablity
- Frequent communication to mentors with industry exeprience to provide better time estimation and monitor over overall schedule. 



### IX. Conclusion      
This project serves as an attempt of remixing two genres of games to utilize the strength of both genres. The way the project is managed and planned also serves as a test to the commercial production -> open-source model of game development. The end result is aimed to foster a creative community of players that can help to grow and improve the game's content through modding and feedbacks, thus improving the project's plability and size dispite only having a limited amount of core development team.

#### Project Purpose
Traditional card combat games usually excel at strategic gameplay and offers almost endless possibilities ands combinations when it comes to combat, but often lacks a bit in terms of exploration and storytelling. And the roguelike dungeon crawlers often do a good job in exploration mechanics, but often have comparably simpler combat mechanics. The project is aimed to combine the strategy-heavy card combat mechanics into traditional dungeon crawlers as well as introducing mechanics like inventory based card deck building and base building into the game. The project is aimed to bring a unique and fresh design into the video game market.

#### Project Scope
The project is aimed to be ultimately published on PC platform eletronically via Steam. _The game should be aimed at a launch date in Q4 2025 - Q2 2026_ 
- The main part of the game should be aimed to have a length of around 14-16 hours.
- The game should have a complete main story line
- The final product should have completed rougelike elements including character skill prograssion and base building
- The final product should have completed exploration elements that has at least 3 different enemy faction/biomes and procedually generated missions & maps with difficulty progression.
- The final product should have completed combat elements that include offer a large selection of equiptment/cards, which can be crafted or obtained through exploration, trading & combat. Or to be further customized.

#### Target Audiance
- The game's primary audiance should be male video game players aged 16-30 years old that primarily plays PC games and has an interest in rougelike games and card games/dungeon crawler games. 
- The game's secondary audiance should be video game players who has had experience with darkest dungeon / slay the spire and is looking for games that incorporate elements from those two games. 

### Platform & Tools
- **Development Platform**: Unreal engine<br />
The reason for this choice is that the current technical build which already has the basic system structure implemented exists in Unreal engine due to current coder's extertise.
- **Version control**: Github<br />
This provide version control within the team, and also enables the open-sourceness of this project after the game launch. The source-code of the project will be published in an aim to further help and enable game's moding community.

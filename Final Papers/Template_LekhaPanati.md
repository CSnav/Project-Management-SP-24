<h3>Introduction</h3>

Raas All-Stars (RAS) is the national collegiate circuit which showcases the traditional Indian dance styles of Raas and Garba, executed by competitive university teams throughout the country. Teams perform their set of the season at bid competitions held at different universities to gain enough points to attain a top nine spot in the nation and perform at the national competition, Raas All-Stars. The first RAS was held in the spring of 2009, but teams have crafted Raas sets since as early as 2001. As of now, the Raas All-Stars circuit comprises over 15,000+ dancers, team managers, competition board members, and alumni across the country. Raas All-Stars is a sub-circuit of the national organization Desi Dance Network, which aims to promote South Asian performing arts in the United States. The Raas circuit is unique, however, to the other circuits in the network as the only dance styles performed in the circuit are Raas and Garba Dancers mold these styles to their liking, as long as traditional elements are still incorporated. 

Competitive Raas teams are heralded for implementing modern choreography to alter the moves of Raas and Garba, essentially creating a completely new style of dance that is unrecognizable from the traditional style originating from Gujarat, India. Fast-paced and stylized, teams in the Raas All-Stars circuit perform an approach to choreography unique to them. At bid competitions and RAS, teams are ranked based on choreography, execution, and artistic elements—how well they integrate their annual theme into their performance. For example, Illini Raas, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign’s competitive Raas-Garba team, competed this past season with a set centered around outer space, and earned the most bid points in the country and third place at nationals. 

Teams begin their season as soon as right after the previous one has ended. They sift through different theme ideas and songs before beginning to choreograph their set over the summer. Team captains start the fall semester by teaching three out of seven/eight songs to their team to eventually record and submit to bid competitions in order to kick-start their season. The process of applying to bid competitions is tedious and time-consuming if not done efficiently. Identification documents, contact information, vaccination cards, dietary restrictions, and more specifications, need to be documented for each and every team member vying for the eligibility to perform, and this process is done every year.  

<h3>Purpose</h3>

Celestify aims to streamline the process of applying to bid competitions for Raas-Garba teams. Each team’s unique login allows them to import data from team members and save it for applications for all competitions they are looking to apply to, so they do not have to resubmit the same information multiple times. This is important as Raas teams typically apply to four bid competitions per season. Additionally, application results are within Celestify, so they will not get lost in a team’s email like they often do. 

Celestify also makes communication between team captains, bid competition board members, and Raas All-Stars board members more efficient and centralized. A direct messaging system is implemented into the website’s design, and contact information for RAS board members are displayed in a separate page which team captains and bid competition board members can refer to for further communication. 

<h3>Target Audience</h3>

Celestify is useful for every member of the RAS circuit—from team captains to bid competition board members to Raas All-Stars board members. However, it is particularly useful to team captains as it streamlines the process of applying to competitions, and it displays application results and next steps to take to confirm or reject the acceptance into a competition. Bid competition board members will be able to evaluate a team’s application in Celestify as well. Close communication with all stakeholders of Celestify will allow the project to continuously evolve and improve, as those who the website is catering to can also provide feedback. 

<h3>Community and Open Source Model</h3>

The Raas All-Stars circuit is very tight-knit, with extensive connections to alumni. Due to long and frequent practices every week, teams become very close, even after graduation. Alumni often oversee the circuit either through communication to their team or by joining the Raas All-Stars board. Celestify seeks to hire Raas alumni who majored in Computer Science, Data Science, and other related fields to kickstart the development of the website. Open source management will be utilized, as Raas alumni are located all across the country, and communication will primarily be through virtual team meetings and chat rooms. Project leads will work closely with these developers to create and maintain documentation for the project, including installation guides, API references, and contribution guidelines. This will minimize confusion that can result from new versions being created, as will managing the source code using version control systems like Git. This includes branching, merging, and tracking changes made by contributors.
	
To foster community between developers who are working remotely and encourage contributions from stakeholders, meetups, retreats, and conferences will be organized. Celestify is by Raas dancers, for Raas dancers, so maintaining a genuine connection with contributors reminds all of us of the end goal of the project: strengthening the circuit and cultivating its growth. Additionally, these gatherings will provide valuable opportunities for networking, knowledge sharing, and building relationships beyond virtual collaboration. By nurturing this sense of community, Celestify ensures that every contributor feels valued and connected to the project's mission, reinforcing a shared commitment to enhancing the Raas All-Stars circuit surpassing what has already been accomplished by alumni when they were on Raas teams. Celestify’s open source nature expands Raas and Garba beyond college students; the Indian folk dance style can be an integral part of dancers’ lives for more than just their college careers. 
	
Another pillar that Celestify will grow on is feedback from users. With such close collaboration with the Raas All-Stars board, communication with dancers will be easy. Community feedback surveys can be sent out through the Raas All-Stars website or social media platforms and will reach a diverse audience of dancers across the United States. This feedback is invaluable because dancers are the ones primarily utilizing Celestify and spending the most time on the website. Dancers having a strong connection to alumni working on the project is also a catalyst for the evolution of Celestify. 

With managing technical debt, Celestify adopts a proactive approach aimed at maintaining the long-term sustainability and scalability of the platform. Recognizing that accruing technical debt is an inevitable aspect of software development, Celestify prioritizes regular assessments of its codebase to identify areas of debt. By conducting thorough code reviews and implementing automated testing processes, the development team will ensure that new features and enhancements are integrated seamlessly while minimizing the accumulation of additional debt. Moreover, Celestify allocates dedicated resources to address existing technical debt through periodic refactoring and optimization initiatives. This proactive strategy not only enhances the platform's performance and maintainability but also promotes a culture of continuous improvement within the development team.
	
Making Celestify open source offers several advantages. Firstly, it promotes collaboration among a vast community of developers, allowing for rapid innovation and improvement. With more eyes on the code, bugs can be identified and fixed faster, leading to more stable and reliable software. Additionally, open source projects often benefit from a wide range of perspectives and expertise, resulting in more robust and adaptable solutions. Furthermore, open source projects tend to be more transparent and trustworthy, as users can inspect the code themselves and verify its security and integrity. This is especially useful for Raas team members to provide their input regarding their difficulties or confusion navigating Celestify. Finally, utilizing open source management can lead to greater adoption and recognition within the developer community, as well as potential commercial opportunities through partnerships and contributions that Raas alumni may be in contact with.

<h3>User Interface and User Experience</h3>

The first page that appears upon loading Celestify is a log-in prompt for team captains, bid competition board members, or Raas All-Stars board members. This ensures security of teams’ personal information and competition statuses. A log-in based website also allows for a direct messaging system, which is useful for dance teams who have questions or concerns regarding the due dates and regulations that come with applying to bid competitions. 

Upon logging in, Celestify seeks to tailor its landing page to whichever type of stakeholder is interacting with the website—Raas captains, bid competition board members, or RAS board members. When any stakeholder logs in, the home page will consist of:

<i>Cards</i>: These are visual representations of each tab the user can explore. For team captains, cards will consist of bid competitions they are applying to, displaying the competition name, host school, and sometimes an image. Captains can click on a competition card to access the respective competition’s application materials, guidelines, and status. For Raas All-Stars board members, the cards will consist of the areas of the RAS national competition, such as production, hospitality, fundraising, logistics, and more. Bid competition board members will have a similar layout as RAS affiliates, with an additional tab with applications. 

<i>To-Do List/Upcoming Deadlines</i>: Celestify’s home page includes a section on the dashboard that displays upcoming tasks that have due dates. For team captains, this could be different materials they have to submit to competitions, like their audition video, identification documents, and prop dimensions. For competition board members, items on the to-do list can include due dates for reserving venues and accommodations. This helps users stay organized and prioritize punctuality. 

<i>Notifications</i>: Celestify will contain a notifications area on the dashboard where users can see updates about circuit announcements, application statuses, upcoming due dates, and direct messages. Users can customize their notification preferences to control how they receive these updates.

<i>Direct Messages</i>: Since Celestify aims to centralize the competition application process for Raas teams, implementing a direct messaging page is vital. Team captains can ask questions to members of bid competition and RAS boards, and communication between board members is all in one place. A main concern with the current application process is that messages often get lost in people’s email inboxes. 

<i>Settings</i>: Celestify’s settings tab is the section where users can customize the appearance and layout of their Canvas dashboard and course interface. Users can have the option to select their preferred language for the Canvas interface. This allows for localization and makes the platform more accessible to users whose primary language may not be English. Users can also customize the layout and content of their dashboard in the settings tab. There will be options to show/hide specific cards, rearrange the order of course cards, and choose which elements (such as To-Do List, Recent Activity, etc.) are displayed on the dashboard. Furthermore, sers can customize how they receive notifications (e.g., email, SMS, push notifications) and which types of notifications they want to receive. Additionally, to accommodate users with disabilities, the settings tab includes options for adjusting font sizes, contrast settings, keyboard shortcuts, and screen reader compatibility. Celestify prioritizes a customizable interface in order to foster inclusivity and appreciate diversity  in the Raas All-Stars circuit. 
	
Upon clicking on the card, different users of the website can perform different tasks. Board members for both bid competitions and RAS can assign tasks to certain divisions with a due date and time. This is crucial as audition video taping weeks are hectic times with precise deadlines. When team captains click on a competition card, they can view deadlines for the specific competition as well as the status of their application. On the bid competition board’s end, they can review audition videos through the website, provide feedback, and publish a decision regarding a team’s application. Teams utilize this information to plan their season based on the competitions they got into and improve based on feedback provided. 
	
As mentioned earlier, Celestify aims to evolve based on user feedback by encouraging dancers to provide input on what features were useful for planning their competitive season.

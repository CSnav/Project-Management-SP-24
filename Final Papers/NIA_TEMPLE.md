## Canvas Connect - A Student Collaboration Platform
Nia Temple, Spring 2024

### Abstract    
My open-source project idea is to launch a communication platform through Canvas to make messaging and collaboration between students easier. The community I want to create this for are students and colleges like UIUC. I think it’s important because many people struggle to organize their messages and meetings when working with students between classes. The goal is to help aid their education and improve academic outcomes.

### Introduction 
The open-source project I plan to create aims to strengthen communication between students and to make collaboration easier online. To do this, I will need the help of a community and collaborators from developers to designers. With this combined effort we can utilize the existing open-source platform, Canvas. Developed by Instructure Inc. in 2009, Canvas is a platform that supports online learning and teaching. It’s used by learning institutions, educators, and students to access and manage online course materials and allows professors to post grades, information, and assignments. As of 2021, Canvas was used by roughly 4,000 universities, school districts, and institutions worldwide, including 11 out of the 14 Big 10 schools and all Ivy League schools (Illinois Online, 2021). Canvas is based on Ruby and Javascript and offers a free, open-source cloud-based learning platform as well as a paid version for premium LMS needs (Kiran, 2020). Because we are working with an existing system and company, we would have to look into licensing issues and the terms and conditions of third party use before working on the project.

Despite the numerous opportunities Canvas provides, it currently lacks useful collaboration tools for students to connect within the platform. This is where my project idea, Canvas Connect comes in. The product I plan to create would allow students to message, call, and create study groups with each other within the existing Canvas website instead of having to seek out other collaboration platforms as they have had to do in the past. Since Canvas is already used by many schools, the product I aim to create will exist as an extension of it. The objective is to introduce a communication platform that simplifies messaging and collaboration among students, mainly targeting those at colleges and universities that already use the Canvas system. The reason this project and initiative is important is rooted in the common challenges faced by students who often struggle to effectively organize messages across multiple platforms, coordinate between numerous courses and organizations, and manage meetings and schedules. College students already have many sources of stress so the goal is to make their lives a bit easier. By integrating with Canvas, the project aims to harness the familiarity of the interface to improve user experience. Hopefully it will also make widespread adoption a simpler process.

By providing a centralized hub for communication, the Canvas Connect aims to streamline workflows and facilitate better coordination, ultimately contributing to a more conducive learning environment. The overarching goal of this endeavor extends beyond mere convenience; it is fundamentally about aiding education and enhancing academic outcomes by appealing to the workstyles preferred by college students today. By empowering them with effective communication tools, the project endeavors to enrich their learning experiences, promote collaboration, and improve learning outcomes, which in turn will also improve the reputability of participating academic institutions.

Vision Statement: 
“The process for college students to connect and collaborate online is complex and inconvenient. Canvas Connect introduces a solution that allows students to more easily collaborate within the platform.”

### Principles
#### Community Engagement
Incorporating community engagement as one of the key principles in our open-source project is a strategic decision that is crucial to the project’s success. By emphasizing the importance of community engagement, we can increase its overall sustainability and impact long-term. By prioritizing community involvement, we can not only foster a sense of ownership and belonging among contributors, but also tap into a diverse pool of perspectives, talents, and resources that we otherwise could not. The following details my plan on how we can actively prioritize community engagement within the project while utilizing GitHub, Discord, and Figma as the primary tools.

First we should establish clear communication channels. Our community members would know that Discord would be used as the central hub for files, coding, and documentation. It would also be actively used throughout the project to provide various channels for discussions, feedback, announcements, and collaboration. Separate channels would be made for different aspects of the project like coding, documentation, design, and general discussions, to ensure clarity and organization. We would also work to create a welcoming environment where all community members feel valued and respected. We would encourage open dialogue, constructive criticism, and mutual support. The importance of diversity and inclusion, actively seeking input from individuals with varying backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives would also be emphasized.

Part of our community’s practices would also be to maintain a transparent decision-making process. Maintaining transparency in decision-making processes ensures accountability and trust within the community. Utilizing GitHub's issue tracker and project boards can help us openly discuss proposals, solicit feedback, and track progress. We would also work to make sure we are clearly documenting the rationale behind decisions, incorporating community input whenever possible. It is also important to keep up with providing regular updates and progress reports. We can achieve this by creating scheduled announcements about project developments, milestones, and achievements through regular updates and progress reports. We would utilize Discord announcements, GitHub releases, and project documentation to communicate important information and collect feedback from stakeholders. In order to improve motivation among community members, we would regularly provide acknowledgment and recognition. We can acknowledge and celebrate the contributions of community members, through shout-outs, mentions, badges, and awards. This can help highlight their achievements, expertise, and impact on the project, reinforcing the culture of appreciation and recognition.

Another way we would promote community engagement is by making things easier to access through organized documentation and onboarding resources. To do this, we would provide comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and general onboarding resources to facilitate participation and contribution from community members of all skill levels. We could use GitHub wikis, README files, and Discord guides to explain project guidelines, coding standards, contribution workflows, and best practices. We could also provide mentorship and support to our newer community members and contributors, helping them navigate the project, overcome challenges, and grow their skills. Once the community is larger and more stable, we could potentially establish buddy systems, mentorship programs, and code review sessions to facilitate knowledge sharing and skill development within the community.

#### Collaboration
Collaboration between developers and stakeholders is also highly prioritized and critical to the success of this project. Strong communication, transparency, and alignment among contributors and stakeholders is necessary for the development and growth of the product. Without these things, there would be no community or growth and the project would likely fail or be abandoned before much progress could be made. In order to make sure collaboration is a key principle valued by all members of our community, we would need to strategically manage our use of platforms and tools- our main ones being Githib, Discord, and Figma.

In terms of management of these platforms, we would support ease of collaboration for our community members and stakeholders by establishing clear communication channels, encouraging open dialogue and transparency, scheduling regular meetings and check-ins, documenting decisions and discussions, and celebrating project milestones. By leveraging GitHub, Discord, and Figma as collaborative tools, we can more easily prioritize strong communication throughout the project, maintaining strong collaboration, transparency, and alignment that will also contribute to the overall success and impact of the project.

#### User-Centric Design
Prioritizing user-centric design in this project is essential for creating a product that meets the needs, preferences, and expectations of its users effectively. By placing users at the center of the design process, we can ensure that the final product is intuitive, accessible, and impactful. There are many ways we can apply the principle of user-centric design throughout the course of the project. For example, during the user experience design process, in the user research and analysis, we can conduct thorough user research to gain insights into the needs, behaviors, and preferences of your target audience. We can utilize surveys, interviews, usability tests, and analytics to collect qualitative and quantitative data about user requirements, pain points, and goals. Personas can also be a helpful tool, reflecting our different target users’ wants, needs, goals, and pain points. Using these personas as guiding tools throughout the design process can help ensure that design decisions align with user needs and expectations. User journey maps can also be a helpful tool that can visually map out the user journey helping us understand the steps, touchpoints, and interactions users have with your product from initial discovery to completion of tasks. Identifying pain points, friction points, and opportunities for improvement aid in optimizing the user experience of our target users.

In terms of the overall design process, it would be highly iterative. By adopting an iterative design process, it can continuously refine and validate design solutions based on user feedback and testing. GitHub can be used for version control and issue tracking to manage design iterations and collaborate with team members. We would use Figma to create interactive prototypes and wireframes that visualize the user interface and user experience of your product and we would iterate on these prototypes based on user feedback and usability testing to refine design elements and interactions. Conducting usability testing sessions with real users would help us evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of your design solutions. It’s also important to frequently gather feedback on usability issues, navigation patterns, and user interactions to inform design refinements and improvements. We would also prioritize accessibility in our design decisions to ensure that your product is usable by all users, including those with disabilities. To do this, we could follow accessibility guidelines and standards such as WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines), and conduct accessibility audits to identify and address barriers to accessibility. We should also try to keep cross-platform compatibility in mind throughout the project. In order to ensure high functionality, we would need to consider the diverse range of devices, browsers, and operating systems that users may utilize to access your product. We can help ensure cross-platform compatibility and responsiveness by testing your design across different devices and screen sizes.

Community feedback and collaboration is also very important in user-centric design practices. Engaging with the community through Discord channels to gather feedback, suggestions, and feature requests from users and stakeholders can strengthen our community and ensure that we are making an effort to listen and take feedback from our community and target users. Implementing these strategies and leveraging collaborative tools can help us effectively prioritize user-centric design within the project and ensure that the final product meets the needs, expectations, and experiences of its users in a meaningful and impactful way.

### Implementation     
This is what the overall lifecycle of the project will look like. We will start by defining the issue we plan to solve in more detail. Because we are prioritizing user-centric design, in order to do this we must conduct research to understand our target users’ current goals, pain points, and needs. This can be done through user surveys and interviews, market research, and competitive analysis. This data can also help communicate with stakeholders so that they can understand the present challenges and why we are choosing to prioritize certain issues within the project over others.

Once we have done this, we can start the design process. More specifically, I am referring to the design of the project management materials. We would have the outlines and systems for our documentation system created in advance so that everything is laid out and organized from the jump. Workflows and timelines would also be clearly defined for everyone in the community. This way there is minimal confusion about expectations, resources, and best practices throughout the project. This is especially important for any key contributors and stakeholders involved in the project.

Using the information we have gathered in the first stage, we can begin creating wireframes, prototypes, and conduct any potential testing for our product. During this stage of development, we will put more focus on the details of Canvas Connect’s coding and UX/UI elements. Strong communication is especially important here as we will be working between various files and channels on Github, Discord, and Figma.

Finally, the last stage of our project roadmap is launch. This is where our product will be published and implemented for public use. However, we expect issues to come up from bugs to integration challenges. The specific timeline for the Canvas Connect project is fairly loose as we will go through multiple iterations of each step in the roadmap and launch multiple versions of our product. Even after launching our product, we would still be heavily involved in tracking outcomes and success metrics to determine any areas that need improvements.

### Conclusion      
Canvas Connect will be an open-source project mainly utilizing Github, Discord, and Figma to manage and engage with the community, developers, and stakeholders. The timeline of the project roadmap would be somewhat flexible depending on project needs and so that unexpected problems or setbacks won’t harm that larger vision for its stages of development. Progress will be documented and tracked using previously-mentioned platforms (Github, Discord, and Figma) throughout each stage of the project in order to make sure everything remains on track and to reduce potential technical debt.

The key principles that will be prioritized throughout the project are community engagement, collaboration, and user-centric design. These key principles were chosen in order to ensure unity and high functionality within the project community. They were also chosen to make sure that we are always circling back to make sure the issues we are prioritizing and solving are the right ones. 

The project plan and ideas described throughout this paper were created in hopes of building a solid foundation for a project community so that it has as much potential for longevity as possible. I don’t deceive that projects like this have a true end and it is difficult to fix issues retroactively. Thus, a huge emphasis has been placed on thorough planning and setup before starting any major endeavors. Ultimately, this project is designed so that it can be iterated and improved upon for as long as users are using our product.

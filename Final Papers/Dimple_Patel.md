# Illini Wellness: Accessible Mental Health and Wellness Resources for UIUC Students

Dimple Patel, SPR2024

## Abstract
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) is a large and diverse academic institution with a growing student population. Given the pressures of academic life, students often experience stress, anxiety, and other mental health issues. However, according to the American Psychiatric Association, about 50% of students have not accessed any mental health services with two-thirds of students not accessing any campus resources at all. For this reason, the demand for accessible mental health and wellness resources is ever present. This paper outlines a hypothetical open-source project to create an accessible digital platform that provides mental health resources and wellness support for UIUC students. It also describes the project management approach using open source principles.

## Introduction
### Background
Although UIUC currently has information on mental health topics through sites such as the McKinley Health Center and the Illini App, it is oftentimes hard for students to find the resources they are looking for due to a lack of organization and accessibility. Rather than providing immediate help, these existing solutions generally require students to sign up for counseling appointments where limited slots are offered. Based on students credit hours and full time status, they may even have to pay a fee for counseling appointments. As seen in the bar graph below, barriers such as student’s limited time in their busy schedules, financial reasons, and more lead to mental health issues being left untreated. With as many as 75% of students reluctant to seek help, the risks of dropping out of college, poor academic performance, suicide and substance abuse have increased.

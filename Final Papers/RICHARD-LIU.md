## English Learning Website
Richard Liu, SP24.

### Project Vision    
There are many people such as non-native speakers who would like to improve their English. We would create a website where they can learn English, while making it fun and easy for users at the same time. There will be learning modules which will go through the various aspects of the English language, such as grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. There will also be exercises associated with them in order to help reinforce the user’s knowledge. To make things engaging, there will also be fun games and puzzles users can do. For example, having flipcards with a vocab word on one side. The user will try to guess what the meaning is and will flip the card to reveal the answer. Finally, there will be progression added in. The more modules, exercises, etc a user goes through, then more points they will get. These points will be updated on a leaderboard and users will get fun unlocks, rewards, and streaks. 

### Motivation
There are many reasons why this project is important. The most obvious reason is that it allows people to improve their English. English is the most widely used language in the world, meaning that being able to speak it is very beneficial. Users can interview for jobs at English speaking companies, be able to make friends with English speakers, get information from English sources, etc. Being able to speak English not only allows one to connect with American and British culture, but also other cultures. Many people have English as their second language, so you can connect with people even if their primary languages are not English. Because our project is a website, it can be accessible from anyone who has an internet connection. Therefore, the widest range of people will be able to improve their English. We will also make it free to everyone, so people who do not want to spend money will still be able to join. Because of its electronic nature, you can add so many features to increase the level of engagement which traditional learning (paper) does not have (the aforementioned rewards and streaks). The electronic format makes scalability much better as lots of users can just sign up instead of having to provide thousands or millions of paper and pencils. The website not being in a traditional class format means there is no time constraint or pressure, making the learning much more flexible as the learner can go at their own pace. 


### Implementation

The first step would be to find a domain name and register it. At first for the sake of convenience, we could use website building services to build the website and database (content management system). However, later on when we expand and the user base starts to grow it is better to use more customized and specialized services. We could use database products such as Firebase to power our website. Whichever database we use, it should have the feature of user authentication so that we can track individual profiles. For the front end we would use HTML and CSS, and the backend would be Javascript. We could even use libraries such as React in order to make the end product better. In terms of website design, we would want it to be simple and straightforward as we want mass amounts of users to understand the website. We would then develop the actual teaching modules and exercises. This would be the mentioned vocabulary learning, grammar lessons, listening exercises, etc. It would be implemented through things such as flipcards and embedded videos. One of the most important aspects of this would be adding interactivity in order to increase user engagement. This is the mentioned daily streaks, goals, and leaderboards. This would be done by having the database include said statistics in each account associated with a user. For example, the score of a user would be kept track of and when the score crossed a certain threshold then the goal would be met, with the score reset. The same is done for daily streaks, but the scores reset after each day. For the leaderboards, the total scores of every user would be tracked and the top 10 would be updated every 24 hours. In order to make the tasks feel rewarding, animations and badges would be added in to show progression. When the website is finished, we should invite beta testers to try out the website. This could be friends and families of the developers, or just random people interested in the project. We would ask for feedback and any bugs found, then we would fix and modify the website based on the advice. After this, we would start advertising to people on a larger scale. This can be done through online forums, social media, promotional events, etc. Once a large enough user base is established, we would then start trying to build a community by adding more developers and designers into the team.  

### Open Source
One of the principles the project will be based on is open source. There are many advantages to making your project open source. Because the source code is available to everyone, this means that there is more transparency for users. Our website will become more widely used and trusted because people will be able to see that there is no malware, data collection, etc. Another benefit is that open source can attract extremely diverse groups of people. A possible future of our website is that we would expand it to people who are living outside the US. The limitation of having proprietary software is that our group of developers have no knowledge of internet culture in other countries. We may not understand the habits and quirks associated with website design and functionality, making it off-putting to new users. By utilizing open source, some developers in Japan, Brazil, etc will be able to use our base model and then add modifications to fit the current culture of their internet. This also leads into the other benefit of open source, which is longevity. Market conditions will always be changing, maybe a competitor may overtake us or our demographic loses interest in our website. However because of open source, the project will continue on with other people from different countries, as they will be making their own version of our software. Another big characteristic for open source is that people are genuinely interested in the project. Other projects that are for profit are liable to getting abandoned when it becomes that clear that money can not be made. Because open source projects are driven by genuine desire, they tend to last much longer. Obviously there are open source projects that are for profit, but open source projects tend to be non-profit. A final upside to open source is that the products tend to be higher quality. Because of the aforementioned diverse groups of people that open source projects attract, there will be more perspectives and insights considered when coding. This will make the project less prone to unseen errors and unbiased in general (Romanyuk, 2020).

### Community

Another principle of our project is community. Community in this case refers to the community around the main branch of the project. A big aspect of the community should be diversity, meaning having people with a wide range of skills and backgrounds. Adding on to this, clear codes of conduct would also need to be set so that no harassing or negative behavior would crop up in the community. These rules need to be enforced so that it is welcoming to all people, therefore achieving the aforementioned diversity. To build a community, there would also need to be a platform on which contributors would be able to communicate on. This would most likely be software such as Slack or Discord. There would probably also be email announcements sent out for important events. In terms of bringing in new members, there would most likely be no application forms. Instead anyone would be allowed to join, with them going through some procedures first. There would be introductory information and policies for them to go over and get familiar with. We would also send them surveys to fill out in order to understand what interests or sections of the project they want to work on. To further build team bonds, we would introduce special events and competitions for members to work together on. Something we would be monitoring would be outstanding or extraordinary members, so that maybe in the future they would take on a leadership position. In order to assign tasks effectively, we would need a place to organize issues. An example would be a Kanban board, with tasks divided into Todo, On Hold, In Progress, Urgent, Done, and Future issues. 

#### Community Commitment
The community workload should follow the Community Commitment Curve. The Community Commitment Curve shows as time goes on the commitment in a  community gets exponentially harder. A possible progression could be reading about the purpose, becoming a member, becoming a contributor on forums, becoming a key contributor on forums, and becoming a leader. The gaps between each stage becomes larger and larger the more you go on. In our case, this means that the more experienced members should take on the harder tasks while the new members should take on the easier tasks. For example, a new contributor should be assigned changing the font of the website while an experienced contributor should be assigned adding interactive pop ups to the learning modules. This is done so that new contributors do not feel overwhelmed with the work and quit early, rather they are eased into the community making retention rates higher. Also, because new contributors are less familiar with the project and understand the documentation, entrusting complex tasks to new members could result in massive mistakes on the website. For actually determining how experienced a member is, we can use community metrics for that. Things such as number of contributions, recency of said contributions, what type of contributions they usually do, etc. 

#### Technical Debt
Something negative that can occur in communities is the buildup of technical debt, where the easier solution is better in the short term but costly in the long term. Technical debt is not necessarily a bad thing, especially if the short term effects are beneficial. However, communities should keep track of and manage technical debt so that it does not snowball out of control. The first step to controlling technical debt is to identify it. This will be done through meetings between senior developers who will do code reviews to find technical debt. This could be things such as buggy code, slower runtimes, clunky UI interface, etc. Through these symptoms, the sources of the problems can be found such as bad testing or inefficient code. When trying to implement changes to get rid of technical debt, it is important to use small, progressive changes instead of extreme ones. Too sudden of changes may be too much for the project and community to handle, causing even more harm in the process (Rouse, 2017).

### Maintenance
Another principle of our project is maintenance. Maintenance in this case refers to the Maintenance around the main branch of the project. One of the things that should be done from the beginning is establishing clear documentation. While in the beginning it may seem useless as there are only 3 to 5 contributors, it should still be done in order to plan for when there are large amounts of developers being involved. No or unclear documentation can make it much harder for new developers to contribute to the website, and may even discourage them from becoming involved at all. Another aspect is making sure there is clear communication between collaborators. Because of the decentralized nature of open source, if good coordination is not made then the project could get very messy and chaotic. An example would be multiple collaborators working on the same feature, resulting in inefficiency. Another would be multiple collaborators all neglecting a bug resulting in problems not being fixed. However, because open source can attract large amounts of people, this means that we can utilize the large amount of manpower. Work should be spread out among people in order to avoid burnout and also avoid single points of failure (Open Source Guides, 2024). 

#### Maintenance Cycle
In terms of the cycle for adding updates to the website, there are 7 steps. The first involves searching and identifying enhancements or bug fixes to be made. This can be decided by the senior developers of the website or through feedback sent in by the community. In this example, let's say that the update is adding a new teaching module. Once the objectives have been set, then there would be discussions planning how those goals would be met and which groups of people will be delegated what task. Once tasks have been assigned the developers will start working, some will work on researching the teaching content and others will work on the designs of the lessons. Once the teaching module has been made, the developers will have discussions on whether or not the teaching module is meeting standards or not. If the consensus is no, then the steps of planning discussions and implementing into code will repeat to be reviewed again. If the consensus is yes, then the updates will be released to a small section of the community. These could be people who volunteered to get the early updates or trusted members of the community. This small group would give feedback based on certain criteria and standards. In this case, the criteria would be if the module is easy to use, is easy to follow, teaches valuable information, has exercises that makes users effectively retain the information, etc. If they determine it is not up to standards, then the process goes back to the planning discussion phase. If it is up to standards, a public announcement is made and then the update is released to the wider community. For a short period afterwards, the website is monitored for any small or minor bugs.

### Conclusion      
Overall, our project is building a website that teaches people in order to learn English. This is done through various lessons and games to make it more interactive. Our motivation is to teach people English so that it may give them more opportunities and pathways in life. For implementation we would use a website building service to house it at first. If the user population becomes large, we will migrate to custom website and database hosting software. Our project will be built on the three principles of open source, community, and maintenance. By making it open source, we hope to make it more diverse and inclusive. This includes the plans for developers from other countries to take software and modify it to fit their online culture. By emphasizing community, we hope to build an environment that is coordinated and welcoming. This way, we will be able to recruit new developers and retain them as well. By looking at maintenance, we hope that the project will survive long term and be constantly updated with high quality patches.

## Gamification Learning Platform

Xinyi Wang, SP24.

#### Abstract    
Technological development affects any area of life, and education is no exception. The goal of this project is to create an Open edX-based gamification platform that is designed to raise learning outcomes. Copying the approach of "Badgeville," a technology known for embedding game-like mechanisms into digital spaces to boost user engagement and loyalty, this program seeks to rejuvenate the learning atmosphere at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Using points, badges and leaderboards in intellectual activities, the platform aims to turn old-fashioned education into a modern and communications-oriented process. Many learners find traditional classroom teaching techniques uninteresting, and hence, they go in by making learning more interactive and enjoyable, which is in tune with today’s technology trends. The implementation of technology has changed people’s way of life globally. To illustrate, smartphones have transformed communication, search and shopping. Similarly, the influence of social media platforms on people's communication and information sharing has changed both public discourse and community engagement. Such agitation reflects the influence of technology, which this educational project uses to evolve the learning conditions at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. By combining the gaming craze with educational material, the platform aims to take advantage of the modern world where digital skills are the basis of modern education.
 

#### Introduction
Over the past centuries, old teaching methods have fallen out of fashion and failed to capture students' attention, easily spotted in institutions where tutorial forms of teaching are continuously losing their audience. Enlightened by "Badgewille", with its game-integrated method and thus its extraordinary effectiveness in boosting learner engagement and retention, here we propose a new design. We've already seen the successful result from this game-integrated platforms. Moreover concerns over distinctive disengagement among students at the University of Illinois as Urbana Campaign and other educational institutions create an urgent need for a tailored approach of originality and innovation to better adjust to the varied needs of the community. The main character of this proposal is a gamified learning platform developed on the open-source Open edX system. With its major focus on making the learning experience as enjoyable and interactive as possible, this platform incorporates points, badges, and competitive leaderboards as its game-like feature. Besides, to make sure that the platform is appealing and thought-provoking, easy to navigate at the same time, UI/UX design is addressed and adopted. A functional UI/UE design plays a vital role in lowering the learning curve and smoothing the overall user experience so that the content can be accessed easily and visually appealing at the same time. With all these design principles combined, the purposes of this invention are not solely to bring back students' attention but also to keep pace with the fast developing pace in education digitalization. By converting passive learning to a proactive process, this platform attempts to fulfill the newborn needs of students nowadays, improve their learning experiences, and bring into being an environment where education mixes effectiveness with enjoyment. This introduction lays the groundwork for a thorough examination of integrating gamification and intuitive UI/UX design in education, intending to revolutionize the educational journey at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

#### Project Background  

Traditional teaching techniques usually don't engage modern students. Less lecturing, taking down notes and memorising facts can make the students feel bored, apathetic, and disengaged in their studies. The project is a new form of education that employs gamification techniques, a method devised after analysing what makes video games so interesting. Incorporating points, badges, levels, challenges, and rewards into the learning can make it interactive and entertaining. Here's an example: Usually, students read a chapter followed by a quiz about it; that chapter becomes a truly active adventure through gamification. Learners can unlock points for discovering central facts, earn badges for perfecting certain competencies, and go through various activities that make learning enjoyable. They can also do group tasks with friends or compete against classmates to push themselves. This project knows many students enjoy competition, clear objectives, and rapid feedback. With its ability to offer all these elements, gamification leaves a notion that learning is just like playing a game and not doing a boring chore. These gamified experiences, if constructed to meet the educational aims of students, can bring engagement, more remembering, and interest in learning.

#### Open-Source Methodology
This project is fully supportive of open-source development principles. They have more opportunities to explore innovation, customisation, and community collaboration. Open edX is used as an open-source learning management system, which, at its core, helps create a gamified learning scenario where the game elements that are not normally possible are introduced. The prevalence of open-source technology goes beyond just the software product itself. Bringing the platform's source code to a global community of educators, developers, designers, and learners for free makes it possible for them to influence and shape the evolution of the project. Developers can make the platform more exciting by introducing new gamification features. In addition, it can be customised to meet user needs, integrating it smoothly with other open-source tools and resources.
Feedback and providing developers with a great incentive to contribute code continues to make the platform highly responsive to the specific needs of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community. This approach contributes to the creation of a community-based solution. Teachers are provided with a venue to publish their lesson plans, a guide on how to incorporate gamification into their teaching, and experience sharing on how students relate to the platform. This collective knowledge plays a remarkably important role. For the platform, the platform is able to evolve. In addition to this, the platform is able to keep abreast of the needs of education. Students are also an important part of this process. Apart from playing the role of consumers, they can also provide effective information to the platform. They can review the code and provide new features. At the same time, they can contribute directly to the project by gaining experience in technology development and teamwork. It's a mutually beneficial process because students also learn a wealth of knowledge in the process.
Diverse and vibrant communities are important. To this end, the project utilizes a variety of participatory methods. One method is through the use of online forums and discussion boards. In this way, all project participants can form effective connections and share information. They can share information, discuss issues, etc. on the platform.. Running regular coding sessions attracts programmers, tech lovers, and students for joint creative processes and speedy innovation. Such events are instrumental in creating new characteristics, collecting users' feedback, and actively using it to solve and improve existing problems. There is a strong focus on creating thorough and precise documentation and tutorials. It allows users with little or no technical knowledge to learn to use the platform and participate in its further development. Providing new contributors with the knowledge necessary to sustain and grow a platform’s user base and developer community empowers a platform.
Carrying out this open-source approach makes the project more than just another education product; it is a continuously evolving ecosystem. This reduces the risk of becoming stagnant and enables the platform to keep up with the latest teaching aids fueled by the knowledge and vigour of the community members.



#### Technical Debt and Solutions
Gamification also introduces complexity to the website, and if this is done improperly, it will lead to “technical debt.” The technical debt is just like taking a shortcut when building something up. Initially, it may seem faster, but disease progression would eventually lead to problems that must be solved. For our project, this might mean the website starts to run very slowly, be very difficult to update, or not work as well for this long. The issue of data management in the gamified site of learning is due to the variety of data used, including student progress, game features, and rewards. Open edX even boosts this data with even more to handle. However, this categorising and analysing process demands a lot of time and effort to control information flow adequately.
The strategy to manage the complexity of this data includes many steps that we will outline. We plan to "Divide and Conquer" the data into smaller groups based on the subject, skill level, or game element type. This causes a targeted and time-saving analysis. Then, "Pattern Filtering" is employed to speed up this sorting process by locating and putting together data patterns that are the same, just as students progress in related subjects. We also set up "Specialized Teams”, where individuals or groups concentrate on specific data clusters that lead to faster and more accurate analysis with the development of specialisation in those areas. Finally, "Regular Data Checks" ensure that data in Open edX is always up-to-date, and regular data reviews help prevent and quickly deal with any inaccurate data.
This method not only removes the technical debt but also. Apart from that, it can make using a website more fun. With this more efficient data evaluation, we can quickly locate which parts of the gamification will work and which may need corrections. As a result, this enables students to have a seamless learning process, making learning more fun and interactive. When involved in gamification elements, like the policy of getting badges or increasing in leaderboards, they get immediate feedback on their progress, which multiplies their motivation and enjoyment of practice.

#### Additional Features
This service takes interaction further than giveaway points and ribbons through a full set of features that allow learning to be personal, fun and delivered. Personalised Learning Paths are the basis of such an approach. Through data analysis, the website will determine students' biggest issues, how fast they grasp the information, and how they like to study. After the assessment, a personalised learning plan is created that suggests activities at the most appropriate level of complexity for each student. As an illustration, an auditory learner might be advised to enhance his learning experience by using interactive simulations and video tutorials. Meanwhile, pupils who prefer working with tangible things may enjoy the labs and simulations. That's why every student in the class stays focused and entertained without feeling overwhelmed or bored.
Collaboration and competition were added to enrich the learning experience and make it more appealing. It provides for teamwork on assignments, problem-solving together, and joint resource utilisation, enhancing students’ social skills and communication and promoting teamwork. To seize students' attention, competitive leaderboard challenges set them up to test their knowledge against their classmates, transforming learning into a game that leaves them with a sense of achievement. Another significant side of Real-Time Progress Tracking is. It allows students to instantly know how they're doing, thereby appreciating their strengths and identifying their weaknesses. Students can take charge of their learning pathway through this.
Similarly, teachers' performance is enhanced by the system that provides them with immediate reports on each student's progress. They can care for those who cannot understand and give more advanced work to those without problems. That is why instruction becomes individualised and attentive to students’ environment. The platform enhances teacher-student interaction to a high level, too. It allows teachers to easily assess students' progress and provide them with feedback that is to the point and personalised. Moreover, ensuring that misunderstandings are sanitised and reinforcing the key points will bring students back on track and highly motivated. The tool also makes it convenient for pupils to pose queries and get more involved in discussions, creating a supportive learning environment where learners don't fear asking questions and offering remarks.
Combining all those elements, the platform is a live and vibrant space for students and teachers to interact and meet their different needs. It makes learning fun and interesting and, at the same time, inculcates in students skills they can use in future. Students take a role in determining what should be learnt, and the teachers can personalise instruction, which is likely to improve the learning outcome of every student. In summary, the approach moves from an old system to a dynamic and involving platform for every person involved.


#### Scalability and Sustainability
The fact that the platform may work for a few invited users will be seen as proof of concept, but the ability to accommodate growth and expand the user base without issues is a huge challenge. We know that different people use different learning methods, so our tool must be customised. We expect some platform pieces to be adjustable and allow users to set up according to their preferences. Moreover, their settings will be saved. This approach normally allows the student to have a better learning experience. With each user that joins our platform, we will remain attentive to the suggestions they give on what they need for it to be useful for everyone. Hence, we will keep on improving our platform. As we would like to manage more users, the cloud services will be used to expand our storage and computing power rapidly. Those limits will no longer be physical servers placed on us, and we can easily grow through this cloud server.
We want to build structures that have real substance, not merely ones that give a good show of strength. In terms of this, the open-source approach is of great importance as it allows our platform to develop and thus improve over time. The developers from the members' community add new features, fix bugs, and ensure the platform remains up to date, thus ensuring relevance and usability due to users' changing needs. Increases in the size of the database will lead to the occurrence of more and more errors. To avoid this, we have systems in place to communicate the double checking of data and fix errors in the short run, as well as an automated test running so that problems become unforeseen. We must keep all the details accurate and updated, especially when more people depend on our platform. As we realise, students also differ in how they learn and get motivated. Some people like to see how well they perform on leaderboards, and others may focus more on tracking their progress and cooperation. As a long-term plan, we want to provide different ways the platform can facilitate learning, whether through various methods or lasting over a certain period. The key to keeping our platform relevant for a long time will be to be flexible and willing to develop things constantly. We will consistently maintain and update the platform based on the voices of users of various backgrounds to create a place that is inviting and one that will be lasting.

#### Conclusion      
We are not only creating a new way for the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign students to learn by implementing gamification, open-source principles, and a proper knowledge of how students get motivated. We’re creating a malleable and suitable platform to provide students with an intriguing learning environment. Think of it like a class that, instead of dull lectures, will be interactive ones where personalised challenges attract students, and they get prizes for their progress. They will be working together with classmates, experiencing some friendly contests and getting immediate feedback, which creates a lively and supportive learning community as the open-source project continues to develop and improve with the help of teachers, developers, and students who keep joining the queue by adding new ideas and solving problems. It ensures the platform is always new and at par with any possible technological changes. The achievement of goals depends on creating an individual-oriented platform. We are taking the time to listen to all students and tweak the games, the platform and teaching techniques so that students of different styles and preferences can adopt them. This means that everyone gets included. No one will be left out. It is more than just introducing new technology or making learning a playground. It is about employing technology to endow students with the needed skills for the digital age. We want to do this by constantly improving and providing the students with what they need; this way, we change the future of education at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, making it a fun, enjoyable and productive experience for all.![image]

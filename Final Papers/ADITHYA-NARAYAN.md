# Growceries
In this paper, I will present an open-source project called Growceries, a gamified app that teaches children about real-world investment skills. Growceries will incorporate three main open-source principles during its development: community-building, agile framework, and workflow mapping. 

## Introduction
The inspiration for Growceries came from a game I used to play as a child called Animal Crossing. In the game, players can buy turnips in bulk at a set price every Sunday morning. Throughout the course of the week, the asking price of turnips would fluctuate according to a pattern. The catch was that if you didn’t sell your turnips before the next Sunday, they would go bad and lose their value. This system, cleverly dubbed the “stalk market”, was a way for players to make (or lose) large amounts of money at once. 

When I began investing in high school, I first learned about the most basic principles of economic theory and the stock market. While I didn’t realize it at the time, I already knew many of these principles through Animal Crossing. For my project, I decided to take the concept of the “stalk market”–a simplified, gamified stock market, and develop an educational platform that teaches children basic investment skills. 

### Vision Statement
Growceries is an app that teaches children about basic investment skills through a gamified approach. Users can buy and sell produce at varying prices and craft recipes with the ingredients they’ve purchased. There’s a catch–if a user stores an ingredient for too long, it will expire, and they will no longer be able to sell it! Within the app, there are tutorials that teach users real-life investment techniques, like when to buy and sell, identifying market trends, and so on. Growceries aims to empower the next generation with fundamental life skills through an innovative and exciting platform. 

### Open-Source
Throughout the course of the semester, we delved into the core tenets of open source project management. It is therefore important to begin with a definition of open-source. The Open Source Definition is as follows: “[The user has] the right to make copies of the program, and distribute those copies; the right to have access to the software’s source code…; the right to make improvements to the program.” 1 In other words, the user has the freedom to alter the software however they choose. The open source movement started gaining traction in the late 90s with Debian, an early version of Linux. Linux is arguably the most popular open-source software. Users can freely modify and redistribute Linux, which makes it the most flexible operating system in the market. There are several benefits attached with open-source. For one, the software can be freely redistributed. Another benefit is that the program must include its source code. Lastly, derived works of the software can be freely distributed. Let’s say, for instance, that I download and use an open-source software. I enjoy it, but I find that it can be better catered to my needs. I edit the source code, modifying it to my needs. Finally, I redistribute the software for free on my personal blog (which is read by people in the same circles as me). This example highlights many of the benefits of open-source–it benefits both the casual user and the developer. 

### Project Management
It is equally important to provide a clear definition of project management. A project is simply defined as “a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result. ” 2 Projects span a variety of disciplines. You can have a project dedicated to constructing a bench at a local park, or you can have a project dedicated to building a spaceship that runs purely on oxygen. Coming up with an idea for a project is the first step, but it must actually be executed successfully. In order to accomplish this, the project must be managed. The definition of project management is as follows: “the application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to project activities to meet the project requirements.” 2 In other words, project management defines everything revolving around the successful deployment of the project. That is, what is the purpose of the project, what will it look like once finished, how will it be organized, who will be working on it, when will it be finished, and so on. No project can be completed without project management, and hence, a project manager. The successful deployment of a project falls on the shoulders of the project manager. 

## Key Principles
There are three main principles of open-source project management that are particularly important for the development of Growceries. One of these is workflow mapping. Workflow mapping is a crucial principle in the development of virtually any project. First, it is important to provide the definition of a workflow as opposed to a roadmap, as these terms are often interchanged. A workflow allows teams to break down tasks into their smallest units. This also allows for teams to assign responsibilities to members. Ultimately, having a workflow allows teams to track the progress of a project on a granular level. A roadmap provides a high-level overview of a project’s goals. While both of these are essential for the success of a project, a workflow delves into the granular details of a project while a roadmap simply provides a high-level overview. Workflow mapping, then, is the process of mapping these tasks in a document. The primary objective of workflow mapping is organizational improvement rather than exhaustive documentation. This means that it is not necessary to map out every single process–rather, you should identify key individuals, resources, and steps that are required for the success of the project. Each team is expected to fill out the specific details, but it is important to follow specific organization-wide standards. Furthermore, it’s important to define what you are trying to accomplish with a certain task. There are two types of tasks: transformational tasks and transactional tasks. Transformational tasks demand some sort of change–for instance–implementing or changing a feature within an app. Transactional tasks demand some sort of organizational change–for instance–figuring out which cloud provider to use.

### Workflow Mapping
There are several ways that workflow mapping principles can be incorporated into Growceries. To create a workflow map for Growceries, we would first have to break down the app’s development tasks into their smallest units. Examples of tasks are “redesign the UI for the market screen”, “implement functionality for pulling real-time stock market data”, or “create tutorial for identifying trends”. These tasks are small enough for a single developer to work on it, and each task can be worked on independently. A roadmap for Growceries would provide a high-level overview of the deployment deadline. For instance, it might have milestones like “deploy MVP by this date”, or “reach 5,000 users by this date”. 

#### Figure 1: Growceries User Flow Diagram

The figure above depicts a slightly different kind of workflow map. Instead of mapping development tasks, this user flow diagram maps out all the tasks a user might do while using the app. Starting with a user flow diagram gives the team an overview of what the app will look like. These tasks can later be broken down into specific development tasks to create a full workflow map. In the above diagram, the boxes highlighted in green represent the specific tasks that are required to complete an MVP, or the minimum viable product. The MVP is the simplest version of a product that can be released to the public for testing. Clearly outlining which tasks are required for the MVP and which tasks can be implemented later on streamlines the development process. Furthermore, the MVP can be completed during a sprint or hackathon. Developing a user flow diagram is crucial for the development of an app. 

### Agile Methodology
Another key principle of open-source project management for the development of Growceries is the Agile methodology. First, it is important to understand the Agile framework itself. The Agile Manifesto states: “Individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, [and] responding to change over following a plan.” 3 In short, Agile is a project management methodology that emphasizes iterative development, continuous feedback, and adaptability. The Agile methodology leads itself to Lean Documentation, a documentation methodology focused on simple, concise documentation that is focused on stable information and driven by the needs of the community. 4 Lean Documentation ensures that only necessary and stable information is documented, avoiding the creation of excessive and outdated documents. This approach helps the team stay focused on deploying functional software without getting bogged down by documentation. Overall, Lean Documentation complements the Agile principles of flexibility and efficiency. The Agile framework is particularly well-suited for Growceries because it allows the team to efficiently respond to changes and implement high-quality software. 

One way we can incorporate the Agile methodology in Growceries is by organizing tasks into sprints. Sprints are time-constrained periods during which a specific set of tasks must be completed. For instance, we might dedicate a sprint to updating the in-app tutorials, or to adding functionality for crafting recipes. Sprints ensure that software is being deployed at a rapid pace, but it is important to not have too many sprints and to ensure that adequate time is provided for each sprint. Having too many sprints in a short period of time will lead to developer burnout, and allocating too little time will lead to disorganized and buggy software. Furthermore, during each sprint, each team will have a daily stand-up meeting. In this meeting, each developer will talk about what they accomplished during the previous day, and what they plan to work on today. This enforces accountability within the organization, and it also gives the project manager an idea of who is falling behind. 

Another way we can incorporate Agile is through the use of a product backlog. This is essentially a list of features, enhancements, and bug fixes that the team needs to work on. This can be done through the backlog feature in GitHub. This feature allows developers to separate tasks into to-do, hold, in-progress, urgent, future, and done buckets. You can also add a detailed description of what the task is, assign members to a task, indicate the priority level of a task, and move tasks between buckets based on their status. Some examples of tasks for Growceries are “choose a cloud provider for data storage”, “set up a development environment for frontend and backend teams”, and “address security concerns for child privacy laws.”

At the end of each sprint, the team will review the progress they’ve made during the sprint. The team will review what went well, and what didn’t go well, and this feedback will be collected and used to plan the next sprint. We will also incorporate sprint review meetings. At these meetings, the team, consisting of developers and a project manager(s), along with stakeholders and important members of the community, will be present. The team will display the updates and added functionality they’ve implemented during the most recent sprint, and will gather feedback from the community. This feedback is then used to adjust the product backlog. Based on the product backlog, the workflow map, and documentation from the previous sprint, the team will then plan out the next sprint. By incorporating the Agile methodology into the development of Growceries, we can ensure that the project is flexible, collaborative, and responsive. 

### Community Building
One final key principle of open-source project management for the development of Growceries is community building. Building a strong community of both users and developers is essential for fostering collaboration and driving growth. Some reasons for community building include “recruiting new contributors” 5 and “improving collaboration and the project itself.” 5 Before we talk about how we can build a community for Growceries, it is first important to make a distinction between the community and the user base. 

The user base for Growceries will primarily consist of youth aged 5 to 12. Users must be able to understand English and have basic math skills. Furthermore, users may suffer from a physical or visual/auditory disability. They also must have a phone/tablet with a recent OS in order to run the app. Since the user base will primarily consist of children who are unlikely to contribute to the development of the app, it is important to note that our community and user base are distinct. 

The community for Growceries (that is, the development community) will primarily consist of independent developers and parents of children who use the app. The former will likely be software developers that are interested in the premise of Growceries, even though they are unlikely to use the app for their personal needs. The latter are parents that might supervise their children’s use of the app, and they can also provide valuable feedback as a third party. 

There are a few key strategies that we can implement to effectively build the Growceries community. For one, it is extremely important to establish clear communication and collaboration channels. Communication channels make it easy for users and contributors in the community to keep in touch with one another as well as people on the Growceries team. For contributors, we will utilize GitHub and Discord. In addition to the source code and the backlog, the GitHub will include important information about deadlines, community achievements, and upcoming events. The Discord will have several text and voice channels dedicated to different development teams, as well as channels for announcements and random chit-chat. For users, we will set up a Facebook page where parents can voice their concerns with the internal Growceries team. 

It is also vital to create clear and accessible documentation for both users and contributors. This documentation should be well-organized, readily accessible, and comprehensive. For users, there should be in-app tutorials that explain how to use the app, as well as a guide for parents to ensure the privacy of their children. For contributors, there should be a .README file that explains why you might want to be a contributor and how to contribute. There should also be an FAQ that answers common questions and addresses common bugs/issues. 

Lastly, it is important to connect with the community. This can be done in two ways. For one, we can provide recognition and support. Users who have gone above and beyond in their contributions can earn achievements, incentivizing their productive performance. Support documentation and channels should be set up so that new and recurring contributors can seek support from others. We can also organize events and activities, both virtual and in-person. A virtual event could be something like a hackathon, and an in-person event could be a meetup between members of the community. By connecting with the community in these ways, we can foster a sense of collaboration and support, driving the success and growth of the project. 

## Conclusion
Growceries is an open-source project that aims to educate children about basic investing principles through a gamified approach. By implementing principles of open-source project management–specifically, workflow mapping, Agile methodology, and community building–we can ensure the successful deployment of Growceries.

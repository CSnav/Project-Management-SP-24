### Introduction
Throughout the academic year, an increasing number of people have shown their need to find and share rides between the Champaign-Urbana area and Chicago on social media group chats. Traditional transportation services, like Amtrack and Peoria Charter, do not fulfill all the needs of students or people who work on campus. People need more flexible pick-up or drop-off locations and times. In this sense, our team aims to provide a more convenient solution: We plan to develop a website that provides people who want to find rides and share rides with a safe and organized place to publish their information. Our project seeks to let drivers and riders spread their needs directly to the public and help them connect and communicate efficiently. This project enables students to save time on finding rides, save money on travel costs, and earn money by offering rides. 

Our project's scope includes designing and implementing a user-friendly website. This website simplifies the process of finding or offering rides. In addition, this website fosters a sense of community by encouraging interactions among students. Our objectives are clear: to deliver a reliable platform that allows for easy posting and searching of ride-sharing opportunities, to incorporate real-time updates and notifications, and to ensure user safety and trust through a robust verification system.

This paper will outline our audience of this platform and how we will cater to their needs and protect their privacy. It also covers user experience design, community engagement, and the governance of our open-source initiative. Furthermore, this paper clearly illustrates some potential challenges and solutions, the project development lifecycle, strategies for sustainability, and our comprehensive approach to managing technical debt. Lastly, in the conclusion section, this paper will summarize our achievements, lessons learned, and future work.

### Audience
The primary users of our ride-sharing platform are the students and campus community members of the University of Illinois. They include those seeking transportation and those wishing to offer rides. The primary users are asked to provide their email with Illinois associated with it. This requirement provides essential protection for users because it prevents others not part of our school's community from doing something that might harm our students. The primary audience typically looks for flexible and cost-effective travel options between Champaign-Urbana and Chicago or nearby areas like Springfield or St. Louis. Considering our users' need for convenience and affordability, we developed our platform. Students often have dynamic schedules that require travel at varying times, sometimes outside the operating hours of public transportation. Also, students want to search for more affordable ways to go to their destinations. Additionally, many seek more direct routes to their destinations, which current transportation does not always provide. 

Beyond our primary student users, our platform also serves residents and university staff who frequently travel between Champaign-Urbana and surrounding areas. This secondary audience includes non-student community members who are affiliated with the university through employment. They may require similar transportation flexibility and cost-efficiency. Just like students, staff members may also benefit from our ride-sharing service, particularly those without access to a personal vehicle or those who prefer to reduce their carbon footprint by carpooling.

### User Experience
The core of our website's design is to provide essential functions with visually appealing elements. In this sense, we keep our UI/UX designs simple, clear, and easy to navigate. We aim to ensure that new users can interact with our platform effortlessly and that frequent users can also find it enjoyable. 

We use feedback processes throughout our website development to enhance user experience and encourage them to keep using our platform. We gather information from potential users early in the development phase through surveys. Questions in the survey include, "Which features do you think are important to keep on the campus riding share website? Please choose at least three from below." We also have open-ended questions like, "Please name features that you would like to add or delete on the campus riding share website." In addition to gathering formal survey results, we gather suggestions and opinions from students around us through casual conversations. Through those conversations, we can better understand their preferences and make corresponding changes to our website. We pay particular attention to the features that they find most useful, such as real-time notifications, clear communication channels, and robust safety measures.

To ensure that a variety of people can access our platform, we enhanced accessibility, which includes voice navigation and screen reader compatibility for visually impaired users, as well as sign language interpretation and closed captions for those with hearing disabilities. Those functions aim to let people with disabilities feel included within this platform and minimize their effects when communicating with others on the Internet. Besides that, our platform also contains a Privacy Concern function that provides a transparent space for users to discuss, seek advice, and report privacy issues.

### Community Engagement
We realize that community engagement is an essential part of sustaining users on our website, so we employ three approaches to enhance user retention. First, we establish online forums where users can discuss their experiences and provide suggestions for platform improvements. These forums are located in the website's community channel and aim to help cultivate users' sense of belonging to our ride-find community. By posting thoughts and suggestions through this forum, users can receive comments from others or comment on others' posts. Therefore, they can feel more connected to each other. 

Second, we distribute surveys and feedback forms on a regular basis. Gathering opinions from those forms enables us to understand users' feelings and common issues and collect suggestions for new features. We will ask questions regarding user satisfaction, such as "What aspect of our service do you like the most / least satisfied with?" and question about the specific feature: "How do you rate the ease of finding a ride on our platform?" and question about user experience like "How would you describe your overall experience using our website?" We will ask open-ended questions like "What changes would make you use our platform more frequently?" By gathering feedback from the survey, we can either fix the problems or develop new features.

Finally, we have beta testing programs that allow a small portion of users to access our upcoming features, and they can provide helpful feedback to help us decide whether to keep a specific feature or not. To be more specific, we select participants from diverse backgrounds, from freshman engineering majors to graduate students education majors. Participants are given access to a separate testing environment with new features without affecting the main site. After some time, we can gather feedback from them and make corresponding changes for the main site if needed.

### Challenges and Solutions
When developing a ride-sharing platform, we might face some challenges. Our team foresees those obstacles and presents corresponding solutions. The first challenges we might face are data privacy and security. Since our platform keeps sensitive user data, including travel schedules and personal contact information, robust data protection methods should be employed to prevent privacy violations and data leakage. 

To solve this problem, we plan to implement stringent security measures. Those measures include data encryption and secure authentication protocols. For example, we encrypt all sensitive user information, such as travel schedules and personal contact details. We use Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256-bit encryption. This type of encryption scrambles the data so that it can only be deciphered by someone with the correct encryption key. This process ensures that even if data is intercepted during transmission, it remains unreadable and secure. We also provide users with information about data privacy to ensure they understand how to protect their personal information. Specifically, we conduct educational campaigns to inform users about best practices for data privacy. This includes advising users to create strong, unique passwords for their accounts and be cautious about sharing personal information publicly.

Our second challenge could be user engagement and retention. Since we target a sustainable ride-sharing platform, it is vital to attract new users and ensure existing users continue to find satisfaction in using our platform. To boost user engagement and retention, we implement several reward strategies. First, users can earn badges and special icons for their profiles as they reach certain milestones. For instance:

First, users can earn badges and special icons for their profiles as they reach certain milestones. For instance:
- **Newcomer Badge**: Awarded after a user's first successful ride share, whether as a driver or a passenger.
- **Frequent Traveler Badge**: Given to users who complete more than ten rides in a month.
- **Community Helper Badge**: Awarded to users who have helped other users in some way, such as by answering questions in the community forum.

These badges serve as personal achievements and visible markers of trust and reliability to other users. They enhance the user's profile, making them more appealing to potential ride-sharers.

Second, we track users' progress and visualize their rewards. To be more specific, we implement a progress bar in user profiles, which visually represents how close they are to achieving the next badge. This visual cue can motivate users to engage more with the platform to reach the next level.

### Project Development Lifecycle
- Planning Phase
- Design Phase
- Development Phase
- Testing Phase
- Development Phase
- Launch

The development of our project involves five phases. The planning phase is our first step. In this phase, our team developed a comprehensive plan for our project, including the scope, goal, target audience, functions, scheduled timeline, and technologies used. Within those topics, our primary focus is functionalities needed, such as user registration, ride posting, ride-searching, and communication among users. We also define responsibilities for each teammate, showing directions for everyone to follow and ensuring work efficiency. We also set deadlines for each progress to keep the project on track.

Then, we come to the design phase. In this phase, we outline the user interface and experience. We aim to provide a user-friendly interface, so we pay specific attention to the needs of students. We have a preliminary impression of their need to seek a quick and easy way to find or share rides, so we emphasize the search and post-ride buttons with attractive colors and effects for the user interface design. We also have clear and easy-to-follow patterns within the platform. To be more specific, we list basic features clearly on the top of the website, and a simple click of each icon can guide users to the corresponding page.

We have two development phases in total. One is before the testing phase; the other is after it. For the first development phase, our developers focus on creating a robust backend to handle the database and server interactions. Also, our frontend team works on implementing the interactive elements of the website. We use technologies such as React for the front end and Node.js for the back end. Once the platform met all our functionality and user satisfaction criteria, we moved to the second deployment phase. The website was deployed using a scalable cloud service to ensure it could handle the expected user load. Before the official launch, a beta version was released to a broader audience to gather final feedback.

Among the two development phases is our testing phase. Alongside our website development, we use both automated and manual testing. For example, we use tools like Selenium for automated testing to ensure the functionality and usability of this website. We also conduct usability tests with real users to gather feedback. For instance, we set up sessions where students could interact with our website. As they stay on our platform, we observe their actions and ask for their thoughts. This process helps us understand what is working well and what needs improvement from a real user's perspective. 

Throughout all phases, feedback is crucial. We continue gathering user feedback through surveys throughout those phases. We also collect thoughts from communication channels on the platform. We use that feedback to regularly update the current functions of our website.

### Technical Debt Management
In the context of our ride-sharing platform project, technical debt might appear due to the choice of an expedient solution now. As we utilize GitHub for version control and collaboration, we recognize the potential for technical debt to accrue if not managed carefully. For instance, inadequate documentation of code changes can lead to confusion. Additionally, using GitHub Packages to manage project dependencies without regularly updating them can lead to compatibility issues over time. To mitigate these risks, we implement some strategies such as thorough documentation and regular code reviews. 

The tool we choose is GitHub, a platform for people to collaborate on projects and allow version control. It is a great tool to select regarding project management, but some scenarios could contribute to technical debt. First of all, not adequately documenting code changes or not providing enough comments might cause trouble for other people who download the same document on their end. When someone tries to rerun the code, debug, or add another function to the script, they might find it difficult to follow what others have done and thus fail to do their duty. In addition, if GitHub is used to manage project dependencies through GitHub Packages, failing to keep dependencies up to date can accrue technical debt. For example, if we use GitHub to keep track of the libraries our project needs (like a list of tools), not updating those libraries to the latest versions can cause problems and extra work later.

There are at least two strategies to minimize the initial technical debt incurred. First, ensure every code commit is accompanied by clear documentation and comments within the code to explain what changes have been made and why they made those changes. Comprehensive documentation makes code inside GitHub easier for others to understand and do their jobs next. A consistent code review process is crucial to ensure less technical debt. The review process encourages knowledge sharing and also catches potential issues early. Open communication is also vital in reducing potential problems and encouraging collaborations. Fostering open communication means encouraging feedback within the team to voice concerns about potential technical debt.

### Conclusion
The development of our ride-sharing platform has successfully filled the gaps and fulfilled students' desire to find convenient and cost-efficient rides around campus. Through rigorous design, development, and testing phases, we have created a platform that meets users' needs and fosters a strong sense of community. Looking forward, our platform will regularly update current features to better cater to users' needs and develop new functions to engage our audiences. Our platform underscores the importance of continuous feedback integration and community-focused innovations.

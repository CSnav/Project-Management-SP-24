### Abstract
In the realm of fashion, sustainability is a growing concern. Yet, accessing reliable information and resources on ethical fashion practices can be challenging. The Sustainable Threads project aims to address this gap by creating an open-source digital platform tailored for fashion enthusiasts seeking sustainable alternatives. This paper outlines the project's vision, target audience, implementation strategies, and the utilization of open-source principles for effective project management.

## Introduction

### Background
The fashion industry is notorious for its environmental and social impacts, including pollution, waste, and unethical labor practices. Despite growing awareness of sustainable fashion, accessing reliable resources and tools to support ethical choices remains a significant challenge. The Sustainable Threads project aims to address this gap by providing a centralized platform for sustainable fashion education, inspiration, and community engagement. Official Sustainable Fashion Statistics further underscore the urgency of these issues. For instance, the fashion industry contributes 10% of all humanity’s carbon emissions and is the second-largest consumer of the world’s water supply. Up to 85% of textiles end up in landfills each year, and washing clothes releases 500,000 tons of microfibers into the ocean annually, exacerbating environmental degradation. However, the sustainable fashion market is on the rise, currently worth over $6.5 billion and projected to reach $10.1 billion by 2025, with an average annual growth rate of 8.3%. This growth presents opportunities for profitability and job creation, with eco-friendly clothing sales projected to increase by $1,574.2 million globally by 2025. Transitioning to a sustainable textiles industry could potentially create 18 million additional jobs globally by 2030 and boost the global economy by $192 billion. By leveraging these statistics and fostering informed decision-making, Sustainable Threads endeavors to empower individuals to make meaningful contributions to positive change within the fashion industry, promoting sustainability and ethical practices for a better future.

### Purpose

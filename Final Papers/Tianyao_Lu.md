Tianyao Lu, Spring 2024

### Abstract

This essay will talk about the design and development of games that teach kids about internet privacy while utilizing open-source principles. With the development of the world, most people have technology at home and kids have their phones too. Children are playing video games all the time. They can play games on computers, iPads, and cell phones, and they are made to be entertaining and educational. So we think teaching kids how to be safe online is important, our game's primary objective. They will receive valuable skills by playing our games. Such as knowing what information can be safely shared on the Internet, what information not, and how to keep personal information private. Using open-source techniques enables us to iteratively enhance the game based on input from players and other developers. Kids can learn how to protect their privacy online in a fun and interactive way.

We will talk about how our project got started, how we collaborated to create the game, and how we connected with the community in this essay. We'll tell the story from the very beginning to the finished game. And emphasizing how collaboration and input from the community make our game better. We'll also discuss the challenges we face during the development. Making sure the game works well on several platforms is a significant task, including PCs, tablets, and smartphones (Apple, Android, etc…) Connecting with the community is another difficulty. We hope to have more people participating at the same time and listening to their ideas so that we can keep our games suitable for players.

We will do this by opening up our game creation process to the public and encouraging player reviews. In this way, we will receive more people's ideas and suggestions. This openness will not only help us make our games better, it will also make our games transparent. We think that having more people involved brings more new perspectives, which leads to greater creativity and alternative solutions. We hope that in this way, the game can be a lot more fun and can also be a useful educational tool. This way of working with everyone will allow us to continuously improve and modify the game to better meet the needs of players.

### Introduction

As times have evolved and progressed, our right to privacy in the online world has become a matter of the most importance. With the ubiquity of the Internet and smartphones, personal data is constantly being collected, processed, and shared, often without notification. I first thought of this topic because I got 3-5 scam calls and texts daily. The calls would automatically show scam callers, while the texts would not. He would trick you into clicking on the site by saying you have a delivery that hasn't been delivered or something like that, and then he would charge you afterward. And the other reason is that I unintentionally met a scammer while playing games as a kid. He said he could send me some gifts to the game account, but he needed to log into my account. So I was scammed. The game is designed to educate children about the various ways in which their data can be accessed, and misused without their permission. Also helps kids to understand that as the internet becomes advanced, not all people on the internet are friendly. This essay will go into the game's conception, development, and implementation, as well as how we used open-source software to continuously enhance it. We'll also discuss project management for open-ended projects. This covers how to make sure that everyone collaborates effectively, how to evaluate the caliber of work, and how to keep a welcoming and secure atmosphere for all parties.

### Purpose

We created this game to educate children about the dangers of excessive information sharing online and the value of protecting personal data. Children should use caution when disclosing personal information online, just as they wouldn't tell strangers where they live on the street. They must be aware of who will access their data and how it will be used. Most small children play games on their parents' cell phones, and their naivety will likely have a major impact on their parents. For example, scammers may trick children into using their parents' mobile phones to transfer money to them. We utilize this game to teach students about the risks associated with data breaches, where personal information can be stolen and might at used somewhere illegal. Kids need to understand that protecting their information online is just as important as staying safe in the real world.

We educate kids about online safety through entertaining and educational games. We demonstrate to them what data can and cannot be securely shared. The game aids in their long-term learning of these skills so they can defend themselves against dangers without being alarmed or overwhelmed. By doing this, we seek to protect kids online and off and assist them in forming safe behaviors.

### Target Audience

The age range for which our games are intended is 6 to 12 years old. This age range is important because kids in this group are utilizing the Internet more and more for a variety of purposes, such as finishing their homework, playing interactive games, and interacting with friends online. They may not yet be aware of the dangers of sharing information online or know how to use the Internet properly because they are in their development they are naturally curious and keen to explore the digital world. We concentrate on this age group to impart to them the fundamentals of digital literacy, which will help them make more independent use of the Internet as they age and influence their behavior. The intention is to arm students with the information and abilities necessary to recognize possible online dangers, comprehend the significance of protecting personal data, and build digital presence-protecting habits.

### Phase 1

First, we determine the key lessons we want to teach our kids about privacy and internet security. We must recognize our target audience and know for whom we are creating games. We must ascertain the kinds of games they enjoy playing, what catches their interest, and how they learn best. We will take the time to investigate and compile data about the kids to do this. We look at their hobbies, the games they prefer to play, and how they connect with them. This aids in our decision regarding how best to instruct kids in online safety. In addition to being instructive, we want the game to be a lot of fun for them to play. We ensure that the game engages and connects with children while teaching them valuable lessons about digital privacy through thorough study. This phase is essential because it aids in the creation of a game that is entertaining and educational, guaranteeing that kids can play it and benefit from it.

Next, we determined which kinds of interactive games would best teach the lessons of internet safety. We consider the kinds of games that kids already like to play and how lessons in comparable genres can help them learn valuable lessons regarding privacy. For instance, we may design entertaining riddles or gripping tales that force kids to make choices that will educate them on how to safeguard their data. We also began crafting interesting gaming challenges and narratives. These tales aim to captivate kids and integrate education into the fun. As they move through the game and solve challenges, kids learn about privacy naturally and enjoyably. This method makes it more likely that students will retain and comprehend the lesson.

Selecting the appropriate instruments and methods is also crucial. Software is required for our games to function across several platforms, including PCs, tablets, and smartphones. In this way, the kids can access and enjoy our games regardless of what they have at home. To make our games accessible to as many kids as possible and give them a consistent, pleasurable learning experience regardless of where or how they play, we select dependable and adaptable technologies.

### Phase 2

We concentrated on growing and enhancing our game in the second phase using the input we had gathered from the prototype. Our goals are to update the game's content, make it more kid-friendly in terms of both appearance and sound and improve gameplay. First, let's add more activities and levels. Every level adds a new lesson on remaining secure online, such as deciding what private information to disclose and why using strong passwords is crucial. These are interactive, enjoyable levels that we created to help kids learn by letting them make decisions and observe the consequences of their decisions.

To make sure our games look amazing and sound fantastic, we'll be collaborating with children's artists and sound designers. We realize that bright, colorful graphics and lively music can add to the game's enjoyment and engagement for younger players, which is why we collaborating with artists and sound designers. Children can be held engaged in playing and learning when they are exposed to engaging images and music. Listening to feedback is also an important part of our process. We will regularly check up with children, parents, and teachers what they think of the game. Their opinions are important because they help us understand what works and what doesn't. Based on their feedback, we made changes to the game. By making these changes, we can improve our game to make it a better view or a better user experience. This is a very important principle because it ensures that the platform remains relevant. Also, this continuous listening and adjustment process has helped us create a game that helps kids learn about online safety in a way that resonates with them.

### Phase 3

In the third phase of the project, we will focus on final testing, launch preparation, and the official release of the game. We consider this phase to be a core part of the overall project, as it ensures that everything in the game works perfectly before it is released to the public. We're going to divide it into three parts here. The first is to do a final test of the game so that if we find any small issues, we can fix them in time. This final test will need to ensure that the game runs smoothly on different devices such as computers, tablets, and smartphones. It also needs to be checked if the game can respond to many players at once without any problems. The second part is preparing for release. As we approach the completion of the game, we will begin to plan how to introduce it to children, parents, and teachers. We will create social media accounts and create ads and posts. Let children and parents have expectations for this game. We will also provide links to player guides and online support so that players can easily understand how to play and learn from the game. The final stage is the official release of the game. We will closely monitor the progress of the game once it is released to the public. If anything does not go well or some bugs come out, we will fix it quickly so that everyone can continue to enjoy the game. We also conducted beta testing with a larger user base to get input on how well the game functions and how effective it is as an educator in real-world settings.

### Communication and Tools

For our educational game project to run smoothly, it's important that everyone on the team communicates well and uses the right tools. We mostly use GitHub and GitLab to organize our work, Zoom, and Google Docs to talk to each other and keep records. Our primary tools are GitHub and GitLab. These two tools are especially useful when many people are involved in creating the project. Because they can manage code, track changes, and discuss issues. These platforms have features like pull requests that allow team members to suggest changes to the code, as well as track issues, helping us track issues and improve ideas. The whole process will also need to record a lot of detailed information. For example, write a plan for the coming week, or record a report. At this point, we will use Google Docs to work. It is important for the record because all of our members can make changes to this one document at the same time. In addition, it also has a comment function, when we have questions about a thing, we can comment on what questions we have. This is automatically sent to each member by email. It helps us make sure everyone understands what's going on. Also, regular discussions are also essential, and we will be meeting regularly at Zoom. These virtual meetings allow us to discuss complex topics as if we were in the same room. We can share screens, show what we're doing, and brainstorm together. This helps us resolve issues faster and keeps everyone informed.

We establish a setting where everyone can see what's going on, discuss ideas, and work together productively by combining these tools. This is crucial to ensuring that our game is completed on time and at its peak.

### Community

Community engagement is a key principle in this open-source project. Participation from the community is essential to the success of our instructional games. We think we can create a game that teaches kids how to stay safe online in the most efficient way by including parents, kids, and instructors in the development process. The opinions and recommendations of the community are valued as they aid in our understanding of what is effective and what requires better. We host workshops and community events to collect these insightful opinions. These gatherings give people a forum to interact, talk about their experiences, and exchange opinions on the game. We have the chance to hear from and pick up tips from the users of our games the most.
We also stay active on social media to keep the conversation going. For example, we can create an Instagram account where we can post updates and interact directly with our audience. Also, we can create a website for our games. The website will include our contact pieces of information (Email, Instagram account, Mail address, etc…) and a “Help Center”. “Help Center” will have some general updates and questions, such as when we will be updating the games. How can I log in, etc… Parents and children can also send their feedback or ask any questions they may have through emailing or sending messages to us. We can also use social media to announce updates or changes to the game to keep everyone informed.
We stay in close contact with the community through these channels to make sure that our games not only live up to but also surpass players' expectations. We can continuously enhance our game and make it a more useful teaching tool for Internet safety by paying attention to and encouraging comments. This constant communication enables us to make sure that our game is always improved and make it continues to be an important teaching tool.

### Conclusion

In summary, we developed this game to teach children the importance of staying safe on the Internet. We plan to continuously improve the game based on feedback from players and experts. The main goal of our project is not just to make games, but to provide children with the
knowledge they need to navigate the Internet safely and intelligently. We know that to make our games the best they can be, we need to listen to our users. So we'll be looking at what kids, parents, and teachers say about the game. Their ideas and suggestions are essential for improvement. Because players and developers see the perspective differently, their input will be invaluable. By keeping the lines of communication open, we can quickly make changes that enhance the educational value of the game and make it more fun.
As we continue to update and enhance the game, our goal is to expand its reach and impact and
help more kids understand how to protect their privacy online. Our goal is for this game to
become a reliable teaching tool for Internet safety among educators and parents." In doing so, we
serve as a reminder of the digital world in addition to creating a game.

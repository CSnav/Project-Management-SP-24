## DealFinder: Price Comparison Website
Daniel Yao, SP2024

### Introduction
In the chaotic landscape of e-commerce, customers are often overwhelmed by the countless options and price differences when shopping for products online. Looking for one product is no longer a simple process of visiting and purchasing from a single store. Instead, it has become a convoluted process requiring customers to navigate through multiple websites, compare prices and assess the different product features. This can often lead to a time-consuming and frustrating experience, resulting in a negative shopping experience for customers. In response to this problem, DealFinder aims to create a user-friendly platform that aggregates product listings and prices from various online retailers. It will act as a search engine for products and return a list of online retailers that sell the desired product along with its prices. Other important statistics will also be provided like price history and potential discounts to help make informed purchasing decisions. By streamlining the search process and centralizing the information, the project aims to alleviate the stress and confusion of online shopping and help inform customers with the best deals available. 
#### Purpose
The primary purpose of the open-source price comparison website is to help simplify and streamline the shopping experience to be as convenient for the customer as possible.As the number of online shoppers increases, the need for efficient and user-friendly shopping solutions such as DealFinder becomes increasingly crucial for both companies and customers. By addressing the complexities and frustrations inherent in current e-commerce, it can make the shopping process much more convenient.

The first frustration is the need to visit multiple websites to find the product and get the best deal possible.  By eliminating the need for customers to visit multiple websites and compare the prices manually, DealFinder can simplify the journey, helping to save customers both time and effort.

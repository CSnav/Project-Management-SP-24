## DealFinder: Price Comparison Website
Daniel Yao, SP2024

### Introduction/Headings    
In the chaotic landscape of e-commerce, customers are often overwhelmed by the countless options and price differences when shopping for products online. Looking for one product is no longer a simple process of visiting and purchasing from a single store. Instead, it has become a convoluted process requiring customers to navigate through multiple websites, compare prices and assess the different product features. This can often lead to a time-consuming and frustrating experience, resulting in a negative shopping experience. In response to this problem, DealFinder aims to create a user-friendly platform that aggregates product listings and prices from various online retailers. It seeks to streamline the shopping process to provide a more seamless and intuitive experience for the customer.

## DealFinder: Price Comparison Website
Daniel Yao, SP2024

### Introduction
In the chaotic landscape of e-commerce, customers are often overwhelmed by the countless options and price differences when shopping for products online. Looking for one product is no longer a simple process of visiting and purchasing from a single store. Instead, it has become a convoluted process requiring customers to navigate through multiple websites, compare prices and assess the different product features. This can often lead to a time-consuming and frustrating experience, resulting in a negative shopping experience for customers. In response to this problem, DealFinder aims to create a user-friendly platform that aggregates product listings and prices from various online retailers. It will act as a search engine for products and return a list of online retailers that sell the desired product along with its prices. Other important statistics will also be provided like price history and potential discounts to help make informed purchasing decisions. By streamlining the search process and centralizing the information, the project aims to alleviate the stress and confusion of online shopping and help inform customers with the best deals available. 
#### Purpose
The primary purpose of the open-source price comparison website is to help simplify and streamline the shopping experience to be as convenient for the customer as possible.As the number of online shoppers increases, the need for efficient and user-friendly shopping solutions such as DealFinder becomes increasingly crucial for both companies and customers. By addressing the complexities and frustrations inherent in current e-commerce, it can make the shopping process much more convenient.

The first frustration is the need to visit multiple websites to find the product and get the best deal possible. By eliminating the need for customers to visit multiple websites and compare the prices manually, DealFinder can simplify the journey, helping to save customers both time and effort. 

Oftentimes, customers are bombarded with too many choices, making it challenging and stressful to determine the best options. Data regarding the product is also scattered in different parts of the internet, making the customers waste time searching for all the information. DealFinder helps negate this by providing customers with comprehensive information, including price history and potential discounts, to help them make informed decisions. By presenting all relevant information in one centralized location, it helps empower the customers to have a variety of options to choose from without the hassle of searching. 

The current e-commerce market is dominated by giants like Alibaba and Amazon. The combined Alibaba and Amazon e-commerce market share is almost equivalent to the rest of the internet. Their wide assortment of options and aggressive marketing strategies makes it difficult for customers to find alternatives to shop on. DealFinder promotes transparency and encourages free competition by giving customers a list of options from various retailers. This will include indie shops and family-owned businesses, ensuring that customers have access to a diverse range of products and retailers beyond the dominant players in the market. It helps to not only broaden the scope of available options but also foster a more equitable and fair e-commerce environment. In doing so, it allows the customers the freedom to make purchasing decisions that align with their preferences and values instead of being stuck shopping at one website.

The main target audience is online shoppers, more specifically busy professionals and budget-conscious consumers. The website caters to individuals who prioritize efficiency and affordability when shopping online. For busy professionals, their main focus would be time-efficiency and convenience. Thus, the website will have a user-friendly interface that is both easy to learn and simple to use. It should only be a maximum of 5 clicks for the customer to reach from the index page to the chosen store page. We will also appeal to the budget-conscious consumers by providing detailed information on prices. This can include price drop notifications, sorted prices, and current discounts information. These useful data will help the target audience to be able to maximize their savings without compromising on the quality. As most online shopping is done on a laptop, a website format would best fit DealFinder.

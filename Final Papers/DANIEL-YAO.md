## DealFinder: Price Comparison Website
Daniel Yao, SP2024

### Introduction
In the chaotic landscape of e-commerce, customers are often overwhelmed by the countless options and price differences when shopping for products online. Looking for one product is no longer a simple process of visiting and purchasing from a single store. Instead, it has become a convoluted process requiring customers to navigate through multiple websites, compare prices, and assess the different product features. This can often lead to a time-consuming and frustrating experience, resulting in a negative shopping experience for customers. In response to this problem, DealFinder aims to create a user-friendly platform that aggregates product listings and prices from various online retailers. It will act as a search engine for products and return a list of online retailers that sell the desired product along with its prices. Other important statistics will also be provided like price history and potential discounts to help make informed purchasing decisions. By streamlining the search process and centralizing the information, the project aims to alleviate the stress and confusion of online shopping and help inform customers with the best deals available. 
### Purpose
The primary purpose of the open-source price comparison website is to help simplify and streamline the shopping experience to be as convenient for the customer as possible. As the number of online shoppers increases, the need for efficient and user-friendly shopping solutions such as DealFinder becomes increasingly crucial for both companies and customers. By addressing the complexities and frustrations inherent in current e-commerce, it can make the shopping process much more convenient.

The first frustration is the need to visit multiple websites to find the product and get the best deal possible. By eliminating the need for customers to visit multiple websites and compare the prices manually, DealFinder can simplify the journey, helping to save customers both time and effort. 

Oftentimes, customers are bombarded with too many choices, making it challenging and stressful to determine the best options. Data regarding the product is also scattered in different parts of the internet, making the customers waste time searching for all the information. DealFinder helps negate this by providing customers with comprehensive information, including price history and potential discounts, to help them make informed decisions. By presenting all relevant information in one centralized location, it helps empower the customers to have a variety of options to choose from without the hassle of searching. 

The current e-commerce market is dominated by giants like Alibaba and Amazon. The combined Alibaba and Amazon e-commerce market share is almost equivalent to the rest of the internet. Their wide assortment of options and aggressive marketing strategies make it difficult for customers to find alternatives to shop on. DealFinder promotes transparency and encourages free competition by giving customers a list of options from various retailers. This will include indie shops and family-owned businesses, ensuring that customers have access to a diverse range of products and retailers beyond the dominant players in the market. It helps to not only broaden the scope of available options but also foster a more equitable and fair e-commerce environment. In doing so, it allows the customers the freedom to make purchasing decisions that align with their preferences and values instead of being stuck shopping at one website.

The main target audience is online shoppers, more specifically busy professionals and budget-conscious consumers. The website caters to individuals who prioritize efficiency and affordability when shopping online. For busy professionals, their main focus would be time efficiency and convenience. Thus, the website will have a user-friendly interface that is both easy to learn and simple to use. It should only be a maximum of 5 clicks for the customer to reach from the index page to the chosen store page. We will also appeal to budget-conscious consumers by providing detailed information on prices. This can include price drop notifications, sorted prices, and current discount information. These useful data will help the target audience be able to maximize their savings without compromising on the quality. As most online shopping is done on a laptop, a website format best fits DealFinder. 

### OpenSource
While notable price comparison websites like Honey and Google Shopping already exist, our platform stands out due to its open-source nature. This distinction allows us to offer a level of transparency, rapid fixes, and community collaboration that is unseen in our competitors. 

For transparency, it is important that users can view the metrics the algorithm uses to determine which online retailers to recommend for a specific product. We prioritize criteria such as price competitiveness, shipping times, customer reviews, and retailer reliability. Some price comparison websites prioritize sponsored retailers to recommend to their users instead of relying on objective metrics. The open-source model helps DealFinder be transparent with the algorithm and its metrics, bolstering trust in the reliability and truthfulness of our data. If users have issues with the metrics, it can be improved and discussed within the community. 

The GitHub platform will be used as the central hub for our open-source development efforts, providing a well-known collaborative space for developers and contributors to access, review, and contribute to the codebase. Users in GitHub can participate in discussions, report issues, and submit pull requests to suggest improvements or fixes. These can then be further reviewed and implemented by the core development team and the community. With the help of the community, it can also help decrease the time required for bug fixes and new feature implementations. By leveraging the diverse skill sets and perspectives of community members, projects can evolve more rapidly and effectively than if solely reliant on a core development team. This decentralized approach not only speeds up bug fixing and feature implementation but also promotes transparency and accountability throughout the development process. 

It is also important to include a platform that allows for discussions and collaborations across the internet. Discord can serve as a communication medium where users can interact with the development team and fellow community members. Discord’s server feature allows for a dedicated space to discuss specific topics, ask questions, and exchange insights. Discord offers a wide range of communication tools, including text chat, voice chat, and video conferencing, enabling users to engage in real-time discussions and collaborate from anywhere in the world.

### Project Plan
In order to ensure a good end product and minimize the accumulation of technical debt, the project will be split into three phases. The first phase will be the bare bones of the website, only implementing essential features. This will only include the price comparison feature for the website. The second phase will involve integrating new features that will make the platform more convenient and efficient. This will involve quality-of-life features that aim to make the overall experience smoother and more enjoyable. Finally, the third phase will be premium features. This involves additional features; however, they are locked behind a paywall. These features will need to be good and enticing enough to persuade users to purchase them.

#### Phase 1: Barebones

#### User Features:
* #### Landing Page
    The landing page will be the initial contact between the user and the platform, offering a glimpse into the features, benefits, and offerings available. It will need captivating visuals to        create a positive first impression and encourage users to further use the platform. The purpose of DealFinder should be clearly written and made compelling for the users. It should also           showcase featured, popular, and high-discount products as the main spotlight of the landing page. The design should be simple and minimalistic to contrast with the featured products, bringing     attention to those products. These products will be the ones with the best discounts and deals to hook the users with the saving potential that DealFinder can bring. At the top, there should      be a search bar that serves as a convenient tool for users to quickly locate exactly what they're looking for. 

* #### Searched Page
    The searched page is the image shown above. After the user searches or clicks on an item, it will bring them to this page. This is the price comparison page which will give a list of              retailers and e-commerce stores that sell the product along with their prices. The list will be sorted from lowest to highest. The lowest-priced item will be displayed right next to the item      image as a button. This makes it easy for the users to identify the cheapest shop at first glance. The button will then take the user to the retailer’s official page of the item. Moreover,        the searched page will also include detailed product descriptions, including key features, specifications, and customer reviews to provide users with all the information they need to make an      informed purchasing decision. 

#### Phase 2: Additional Features
* #### Account Page
    The additional feature of a personal account will be added. This will include pages that are necessary for accounts: Sign up Page, Sign in Page, and Personal Account Page. This will allow         users to have a more personalized experience, helping to foster loyalty and engagement with the platform. It will also be beneficial for the user as more relevant information can be given to      them like exclusive offers, wishlists, and notifications.
  - #### Sign up Page
       Sign up Page will enable new users to easily register by providing basic information such as their email address, username, and password. Optionally, additional information such as date of        birth and location may be requested to further personalize the user's experience. This information can be used to tailor their experience on the platform, such as displaying stores and            deals available in their area, providing localized recommendations, or offering location-based promotions. It would also be helpful to know the shipping information and use that as a              metric for price comparison.   
  - #### Sign in Page
       Once registered, users can access the platform through the Sign in Page, where they will enter their credentials to log in securely.
  - #### Account Page
       Upon logging in, users will be directed to their Personal Account Page, where they can manage their profile information and manage their saved items or wishlist. In the Account Page, they         can fill in or make changes to their personal information like location.

* #### Liked Items Page

    The Liked Items Page provides users with a convenient space to manage their saved items, wishlists, and preferences. Users can easily bookmark products they're interested in by clicking the       heart button next to each item throughout the platform. This can be seen in the image above. These saved items are then accessible on the Save Features Page, where users can organize them         into different categories or lists for easier reference. Additionally, users may have the option to receive notifications or updates about saved items, such as price drops or availability         changes. This feature is only available for users that have made an account as the liked items are bound to their account. This feature will help enhance the convenience of users by allowing      users to stay informed about their favorite products. 
* #### Additional improvements to Searched Page
#### Phase 3: Premium Features
